# Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA) — Practical Guide

## 1) What MTA Is
**Multi-Touch Attribution (MTA)** allocates conversion credit across **all** touchpoints in a user journey (ads, email, search, social, etc.). You can use:
- **Rule-based models**: last-click, first-click, linear, time-decay, U/W-shaped (fast to launch, can be biased).
- **Data-driven models**: Markov chains (removal effect), Shapley/Harsanyi (marginal contribution), or ML-based methods (more realistic, needs better data & compute).

> Why this matters: upper-funnel media (e.g., display/video) often drives branded search and direct visits later. MTA helps you avoid over-crediting the final touch.

## 2) Five Decisions to Lock Down
1. **Touchpoint scope** — Clicks only, or include *viewable impressions* and *time-in-view*?
2. **Conversion definition** — Purchase, app activation, qualified lead, store visit, etc.
3. **Lookback window** — e.g., 7/14/30 days; consider different windows by channel.
4. **Debiasing** — Handle brand terms separately, dedupe rapid repeats, anti-fraud, cross-device identity.
5. **Validation** — Run geo/A-B incrementality tests and reconcile MTA with MMM for budget decisions.

## 3) Real-World, Already-Deployed Examples

### A. Google Ads → Data-Driven Attribution (DDA) as default
- Google moved to **Data-Driven Attribution as the default** model for new conversions and later streamlined legacy rules-based models.
- Helpful docs:
  - Google Ads announcements: “data-driven attribution is the default.”  
    https://support.google.com/google-ads/announcements/9048695?hl=en
  - Google Ads Help: “first click, linear, time decay, and position-based models are no longer supported.”  
    https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6259715?hl=en

### B. Adobe (off-the-shelf algorithmic attribution)
- Adobe Analytics & Customer Journey Analytics document an algorithm based on the **Harsanyi Dividend** (a generalization of Shapley) for algorithmic attribution.
- Official docs:
  - Adobe Analytics — Algorithmic Attribution

  - Adobe CJA — Attribution Panel / Algorithmic Attribution

### C. Automotive case study (Markov-based MTA)
- A published whitepaper applies **Markov-chain MTA** to multi-channel automotive marketing and shows how removal effects guide media optimization.

## 4) Why Data-Driven Beats Last-Click
- **Last-click** over-rewards the final touchpoint.
- **Markov** estimates each channel’s *removal effect* (how conversion probability drops if a channel is removed).
- **Shapley/Harsanyi** splits credit by each channel’s *marginal contribution* across all path permutations.
- Net result: better alignment with true influence, especially when upper-funnel channels seed demand that later converts via branded search.

## 5) Starter Workflow (teams can adopt quickly)
1. **Baseline** — Run a simple **time-decay** model to verify data quality and sanity-check channel ordering.
2. **Data-driven** — Add **Markov (removal effect)** and/or **Shapley/Harsanyi** on path-level data; sample/parallelize if paths are huge.
3. **Validate** — Use **geo/A-B experiments** on key channels; feed incremental lift back as priors/constraints.
4. **Budgeting** — Align findings with **MMM** for cross-channel ROI and spend reallocation.
5. **Governance** — Respect privacy (ATT/ITP), use consented IDs/aggregate modeling, and maintain repeatable pipelines.
