WMT
Data Platform & Engineering
- Architected a PB-scale unified data platform for batch and streaming across Compliance, H&W, and Brand Protection.
- Built streaming pipelines (2K+ QPS) using Dataflow, Spark, Pub/Sub—enabled sub-minute fraud alerting.
- Reduced onboarding time 60% via modular pipeline templates; cut infra costs 30% via Hadoop-to-GCP migration.
- Designed schemas and models for transactional, event, and time-series data (BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Cassandra).
- Integrated ElasticSearch/Solr for scalable fraud signal search; developed enrichment pipelines with event-time joins.
- Enabled near real-time classification at scale using Spark + BigQuery ML; implemented robust data quality and lineage systems.

AI/ML Innovation
- Built NLP models (BERT, transformers) for social data parsing—boosted brand alert accuracy by 40%.
- Deployed real-time fraud classifiers (XGBoost, Vertex AI, Dataflow), improving recall by 45%, cutting latency by 60%.
- Integrated feedback loops for continuous model improvement (+8% accuracy in 2 months).

Leadership & Strategy
- Led 15+ engineers/scientists across ML, data, and infra; built a high-impact, innovation-driven culture.
- Drove ETL and fraud prevention roadmap aligned to governance and business KPIs.
- Partnered with Legal/Product/Compliance to define data domains and deliver fraud platforms saving millions.
