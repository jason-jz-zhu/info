# ðŸ“˜ Technical Design Document  
**Self-Service Data Collaboration & Activation Platform (Reusable, Codeless Capability)**

---

## 1. Problem Statement & Objectives

### Pain Points
- Business teams struggle to contribute data because current processes are:
  - **Engineering-heavy** (require scripts, ETL code, API knowledge)
  - **Manual and siloed** (spreadsheets via email, ad-hoc imports)
  - **Non-governed** (no approvals, no audit trail)
- Data often lacks standardization and quality before reaching pipelines, leading to rework, errors, and delays.

### Objectives
- Allow business users to **easily onboard new datasets without code**.
- Provide a **structured, governed workflow** from submission â†’ review â†’ activation.
- **Reduce engineering burden** on ad-hoc ingestion tasks.
- Ensure all contributed data is **high quality, standardized, and auditable** before use.

## 2. Goals

| Term          | Goal                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Short-term** | â€¢ Stand up a working platform for business users to submit and review data  <br>â€¢ Provide visual transformation tools and validation rules <br>â€¢ Integrate with 1â€“2 pilot pipelines |
| **Long-term**  | â€¢ Expand to cross-domain use cases (AdTech, Risk, Analytics, etc.) <br>â€¢ Enable reusable rules/templates for common data types <br>â€¢ Fully self-service: no-code, real-time validation, approvals, automated publishing <br>â€¢ Robust governance and auditability |

---

## 3. Current State

- Users send CSV/Excel via email or shared folders
- Engineers manually clean, validate, and ingest into data lakes
- No version control, audit log, or governance
- Limited reuse â€” every ingestion is bespoke
- Long lead time (days/weeks) from user data submission to availability in pipelines

---

## 4. Solution Architecture (Codeless Self-Service Platform)

### High-Level Flow
**Data Ingestion UI**
- Drag-and-drop upload, form-based templates
- Schema autodetection, format validation, PII scan

**Data Transformation & Enrichment Studio**
- Visual column mapping, type conversion, calculated fields
- Reusable transformation recipes/templates
- Built-in profiling (null %, unique count, etc.)

**Review & Approval Workflow**
- Peer or admin review
- Commenting, change requests
- Version control and approval status tracking

**Publishing / Activation Layer**
- Publish approved data to designated data lake paths, APIs, or tables
- Optionally trigger downstream pipelines (marketing, analytics, etc.)

**Governance & Logging**
- Full audit trail of all user actions
- Role-based access, dataset tagging, and lineage tracking

### Technical Characteristics
- Microservices-based
- React/TypeScript front-end (visual studio)
- Backend: Python/Java services for validation, metadata store (Postgres/Neo4j), data lake (S3/GCS), orchestration (Airflow)
- APIs for downstream pipelines to subscribe to approved datasets

---

## 5. Use Cases (AdTech Examples)

- **Audience Segmentation Upload**  
  Marketing team uploads customer list with demographics, system validates, enriches, and publishes to audience DB for targeting.

- **Campaign Metadata Submission**  
  Media team submits campaign details (budget, channels, creatives) which get validated, approved, and pushed to the campaign config store.

- **3rd-Party Data Vendor Feeds**  
  Partner data files (device graph, location data) onboarded via no-code UI, reviewed by data governance team, then activated for enrichment pipelines.

## 6. What Industry Best Looks Like

| Platform                    | Capabilities                                                           | Notes                                |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Segment**                  | Visual source setup, schema detection, transformations, tracking plan enforcement | Great UI for onboarding events/data  |
| **RudderStack**               | Source-destination mapping, warehouse sync, consent tracking            | Open source, developer-friendly      |
| **Adobe Experience Platform** | Drag-and-drop dataflows, schema registry, data governance, real-time profiles | Strong enterprise-grade governance   |
| **Atlan / Collibra**            | Data catalog + workflows, approvals, lineage                                | Strong governance but less transformation UI |

**Key Trends**
- Visual data prep, schema auto-detection
- Reusable transformation templates
- Approval workflows and lineage tracking
- Integration APIs for activation

## 7. Existing Platform Evaluation

**Current Gaps**
- Manual, engineer-driven ingestion â†’ No self-service
- No standardized schema enforcement
- No review/approval workflow
- No versioning, audit, or lineage
- Long time-to-activation (days/weeks)

**Implication**
Business cannot rapidly contribute data, and engineering is a bottleneck.

**Additional Observations**
- Process inefficiency: Each new dataset requires custom ETL
- Governance gaps: No visibility, no data ownership defined
- Scalability: Cannot handle multiple datasets or users concurrently
- Technical debt: High maintenance, low extensibility

---

## 8. Personas & Stakeholder Journey

**Personas**
- **Business User (Marketer/Analyst)** â€” Upload data, transform with visual tools, submit for approval
- **Data Steward (Reviewer)** â€” Validate schema & quality, approve or reject submissions
- **Platform Engineer/Architect** â€” Maintain infrastructure, create templates, manage downstream integrations

**Journey**
1. Upload dataset  
2. Validate schema  
3. Apply transformations  
4. Submit for review  
5. Reviewer approves  
6. System publishes  
7. Downstream consumption

---

## 9. User Experience Flows

**Key Flows**
- **Upload:** Drag-and-drop â†’ schema auto-detect â†’ validation errors shown â†’ field editing
- **Transform:** Visual mapping, deduplication, calculated fields, enrichment joins
- **Review:** Approver sees data preview, comments, approves/rejects
- **Publish:** User selects destination (lake table, Snowflake schema, API), triggers automation

---

## 10. Data Governance & Compliance
