# üìò Technical Design Document  
**Self-Service Data Collaboration & Activation Platform (Reusable, Codeless Capability)**

---

## 1. Problem Statement & Objectives

### Pain Points
- Business teams struggle to contribute data because current processes are:
  - **Engineering-heavy** (require scripts, ETL code, API knowledge)
  - **Manual and siloed** (spreadsheets via email, ad-hoc imports)
  - **Non-governed** (no approvals, no audit trail)
- Data often lacks standardization and quality before reaching pipelines, leading to rework, errors, and delays.

### Objectives
- Allow business users to **easily onboard new datasets without code**.
- Provide a **structured, governed workflow** from submission ‚Üí review ‚Üí activation.
- **Reduce engineering burden** on ad-hoc ingestion tasks.
- Ensure all contributed data is **high quality, standardized, and auditable** before use.

## 3. Current State

- Users send CSV/Excel via email or shared folders
- Engineers manually clean, validate, and ingest into data lakes
- No version control, audit log, or governance
- Limited reuse ‚Äî every ingestion is bespoke
- Long lead time (days/weeks) from user data submission to availability in pipelines

---

## 4. Solution Architecture (Codeless Self-Service Platform)

### High-Level Flow

- Drag-and-drop upload, form-based templates
- Schema autodetection, format validation, PII scan

**Data Transformation & Enrichment Studio**
- Visual column mapping, type conversion, calculated fields
- Reusable transformation recipes/templates
- Built-in profiling (null %, unique count, etc.)

**Review & Approval Workflow**
- Peer or admin review
- Commenting, change requests
- Version control and approval status tracking

**Publishing / Activation Layer**
- Publish approved data to designated data lake paths, APIs, or tables
- Optionally trigger downstream pipelines (marketing, analytics, etc.)

**Governance & Logging**
- Full audit trail of all user actions
- Role-based access, dataset tagging, and lineage tracking

### Technical Characteristics
- Microservices-based
- React/TypeScript front-end (visual studio)
- Backend: Python/Java services for validation, metadata store (Postgres/Neo4j), data lake (S3/GCS), orchestration (Airflow)
- APIs for downstream pipelines to subscribe to approved datasets

---

## 5. Use Cases (AdTech Examples)

- **Audience Segmentation Upload**  
  Marketing team uploads customer list with demographics, system validates, enriches, and publishes to audience DB for targeting.

- **Campaign Metadata Submission**  
  Media team submits campaign details (budget, channels, creatives) which get validated, approved, and pushed to the campaign config store.

- **3rd-Party Data Vendor Feeds**  
  Partner data files (device graph, location data) onboarded via no-code UI, reviewed by data governance team, then activated for enrichment pipelines.

## 7. Existing Platform Evaluation

**Current Gaps**
- Manual, engineer-driven ingestion ‚Üí No self-service
- No standardized schema enforcement
- No review/approval workflow
- No versioning, audit, or lineage
- Long time-to-activation (days/weeks)

**Implication**
Business cannot rapidly contribute data, and engineering is a bottleneck.

**Additional Observations**
- Process inefficiency: Each new dataset requires custom ETL
- Governance gaps: No visibility, no data ownership defined
- Scalability: Cannot handle multiple datasets or users concurrently
- Technical debt: High maintenance, low extensibility
