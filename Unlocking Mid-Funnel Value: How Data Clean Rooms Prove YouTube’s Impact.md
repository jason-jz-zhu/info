# Releasing Mid-Funnel Value: Evidence That Proves YouTube’s Impact

Mid-funnel channels like **YouTube** and **Display** are often underappreciated in today’s digital marketing world. Attribution based on traditional measurement frameworks, such as **Last-Touch Attribution (LTA)**, assigns sole credit to the final channel before a conversion. This falsely diminishes early-funnel influencers—even though they are essential in forming customer intent.

That’s where **Data Clean Rooms (DCRs)** enter the picture. By securely linking advertiser first-party data with media platform exposure data, DCRs offer a privacy-safe methodology to evaluate the real impact of early and mid-funnel channels.

## Why Last-Touch Attribution Falls Short  

Imagine a customer’s journey:

- They start with an **ad on YouTube** for a Capital One credit card.  
- They later **search for credit card offerings**.  
- They **click an email or search ad** and apply.  

In an LTA world, only the **last click** (email or search) is credited. YouTube appears to have added no value, despite the fact that it **planted the seed** that led to the eventual sale.  

This under-measurement results in **under-investment** in high-value upper-funnel channels such as YouTube.

## How Data Clean Rooms Are Changing the Game  

The concept of a **Data Clean Room (DCR)** allows advertisers to connect the dots between platform-level exposure and their own conversion results. Here’s how it helps:  

### 1. Exposure Attribution  
DCRs enable measurement of **ad views rather than just clicks**. This makes it possible to check whether an applicant was exposed to YouTube content in the days or weeks before applying, even if YouTube wasn’t the final channel.  

### 2. Multi-Touch Path Analysis  
With DCRs, you can track **complete conversion paths** such as:  

- *YouTube → Search → Email → Application*  
- *YouTube → Display → Application*  

This demonstrates how often YouTube is an **early activator** in the funnel.  

### 3. Incremental Lift Studies  
Clean rooms facilitate **test vs. control experiments**:  

- **Test group**: YouTube ad viewers  
- **Control group**: similar users who did not see YouTube ads  

Application rates across groups reveal **incremental lift**, providing evidence of YouTube’s causal effect.

## Real-World Examples  

### Path Distribution Example  
In one study, **30%** of funded applications had some form of YouTube touchpoint.  
- Only **5%** were last-touch.  
- **25%** were earlier exposures that influenced intent.  

### Incremental Lift Example  
- **YouTube ad viewers**: 2.0% application rate  
- **Non-viewers**: 1.2% application rate  
→ YouTube increased conversions by **67%**.  

### Multi-Channel Synergy  
Many successful paths looked like:  

- *YouTube → Search → Application*  

Without YouTube, the **searching phase may not have even taken place**.

## Why This Matters for Marketers  

By using DCRs, marketers can:  

- **Discover the discovery**: Uncover YouTube’s influence in the early funnel.  
- **Demonstrate causality**: Validate budget decisions with incrementality testing.  
- **Capture synergy**: Measure how YouTube collaborates with search, display, and email.  

Overall, this creates a more **balanced attribution model**, ensuring high-value awareness investments aren’t underfunded.

## Key Takeaway  

**Data Clean Rooms fulfill mid-funnel channels’ potential.**  
For Capital One and other brands, DCRs are proof that YouTube isn’t just a **brand play** — it’s a **conversion driver** that warrants scaled investment.
