Batch → Streaming Migration Plan
1. Current Status

Workload: Batch pipeline currently processes data using PySpark + AWS Glue

Frequency: Daily ingestion (~10M events/day)

Sources: AdTech / Marketing data (clickstream, campaign logs, SEM data)

Outputs: Dashboards, ML model inputs, Campaign Manager reports

Latency: Batch → up to several hours delay

Infra: AWS Glue + S3 (batch), Spark jobs for joins and aggregations

2. Business Drivers

Need sub-second to near-real-time latency for campaign optimization

Enable faster decision-making for marketing spend and bidding

Support real-time monitoring (fraud detection, anomaly alerts)

Provide low-latency feature feeds to ML models

3. Concerns & Risks

Data Accuracy & Consistency

Deduplication across streaming events

Exactly-once processing vs. at-least-once delivery

Join Complexity

Real-time joins across streams (e.g., ad impressions + clicks + conversions)

Cost Management

Streaming infra (Kinesis, Kafka, Flink, etc.) can be expensive if not tuned

Compliance & Security

Handling PCI/PII data in real-time (masking, encryption, logging)

Operational Complexity

Monitoring, alerting, replay/recovery from streaming failures

4. Proposed Streaming Architecture

Ingestion Layer

AWS Kinesis Data Streams / Kafka (for raw event ingestion)

Processing Layer

AWS Kinesis Data Analytics / Flink for real-time transformations

Option: Spark Structured Streaming for consistency with batch jobs

Storage Layer

S3 (data lake for cold storage + replays)

DynamoDB / Elasticache (real-time state stores for joins/lookups)

Serving Layer

Redshift / Snowflake (analytical queries)

Real-time APIs for dashboards & ML models

Monitoring & Governance

CloudWatch + custom metrics for latency, throughput, error rates

Data quality checks (similar to Great Expectations / Deequ)

5. Migration Approach

Step 1 – Hybrid / Lambda Architecture

Keep batch pipeline running

Introduce streaming pipeline in parallel for select use cases (e.g., fraud detection, real-time dashboards)

Step 2 – Data Validation

Compare streaming output vs. batch output (accuracy, completeness)

Run shadow testing before production cutover

Step 3 – Incremental Rollout

Gradually move more workloads from batch to streaming

Keep fallback option to batch in case of streaming issues

Step 4 – Full Cutover

Decommission redundant batch jobs

Optimize cost and performance of streaming infra

6. Next Steps

POC Selection – Identify 1–2 use cases (real-time dashboards, anomaly alerts)

Architecture Choice – Decide between AWS-native (Kinesis stack) vs. open-source (Kafka + Flink)

Data Quality Framework – Implement real-time validation & reconciliation against batch

Cost Estimation – Evaluate infra cost for 10M+ daily events

Security Review – Ensure compliance (PII handling, encryption at rest & in transit)

Team Readiness – Upskill team on streaming frameworks & monitoring best practices

7. Long-Term Enhancements

Auto-scaling & serverless streaming pipelines (Kinesis + Lambda)

Real-time feature store for ML (Feast, Tecton, or custom DynamoDB-based)

Integration with Clean Rooms (AWS Clean Rooms, Google Ads Data Hub)

Multi-cloud / Open-source option (Kafka/Flink) to avoid vendor lock-in
