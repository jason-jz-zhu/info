Query & Analysis

Are there any query limits, such as row-level restrictions, aggregation thresholds, or differential privacy constraints?

How are join keys matched across participants (e.g. hashed join keys, salted hashing)?

Are there built-in analysis templates or reusable query modules provided by Meta? Currently, I only see two templates (Lift and Match Rate) — are there more available?

What levels of data granularity can we access from Meta’s clean room (aggregated data only, or other levels as well)?

Data Structure & Operations

What are the table structures or schemas that Meta will share, and how will the data be organized when put into AWS Clean Room?

What levels of operations are supported in AWS Clean Room (aggregation, list, custom queries, etc.)?

Does Meta support hashed ID mapping between Meta’s dataset and our dataset?

Meta will not run any queries directly on our dataset, correct? (We plan to also add restrictions on our tables.)

Data Ingestion & Quality

When Meta performs data ingestion or preparation, what data validation and quality checks are applied during ingestion?

How frequently will the data be refreshed by Meta within their clean room?

Access & Permissions

After we provide the necessary information to Meta, how long does it usually take for Meta to accept and activate our invitation to collaborate?

In the results delivery setup, Meta requires selecting both Meta and the COF as viewers — can we choose to make the results visible only to ourselves?

Privacy & Differential Privacy

We noticed AWS Clean Room currently requires turning off differential privacy to proceed — do we know when Meta will support differential privacy in their clean room solution?
