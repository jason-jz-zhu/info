# 🎯 Funnel Basics  

Marketing efforts are typically mapped to the **customer journey funnel**, which outlines how individuals transition from **awareness → consideration → conversion**.  

- **Upper Funnel → Awareness**  
- **Mid Funnel → Consideration**  
- **Lower Funnel → Conversion**  

Each stage has its own **objectives, target audiences, tactics, and KPIs**. The most effective strategies align campaigns with the stage of the funnel where the customer currently sits.

## 🔗 Extended Insights  

### 1. Full-Funnel Integration

- With third-party cookie deprecation, **PII-based connections and clean rooms** will make funnel measurement more reliable.

- **Conversion:** Use urgency (limited-time offers, countdown timers).  

### 4. Metrics Alignment

- **Mid funnel:** Track engagement and intent signals.  
- **Lower funnel:** Prioritize conversion and revenue metrics.
