0. Introduction: Clean Rooms

AWS Clean Rooms is a privacy-enhancing data collaboration service that allows multiple parties to analyze combined datasets without sharing raw data. It enables organizations like Capital One to gain aggregated performance insights across partner datasets (e.g., marketing platforms, data providers) while preserving confidentiality, enforcing governance controls, and ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks.

This assessment evaluates AWS Clean Rooms across business considerations, product capabilities, and technical implementation aspects to support decision-making for enterprise adoption.

1. Business Considerations
1.1 Data Collaboration Needs

Secure Multi-Party Collaboration
Enable data analysis across external partners (e.g., Meta, Pinterest, Reddit) without exposing customer-level data.

Marketing and Analytics Use Cases
Support overlap analysis, incrementality, lift studies, and cross-platform attribution while protecting PII.

Clear Role and Cost Separation
Define which partner runs queries, who can view results, and who pays for compute‚Äîreducing disputes and enabling accountability.

Time-to-Value and Reusability
Allow business analysts to use pre-approved query templates to reduce legal and security reviews for every collaboration.

1.2 Compliance and Regulatory Requirements

Privacy and Data Protection

Enforces data minimization and prevents raw data sharing.

Uses aggregation thresholds, output constraints, and join key hashing to prevent re-identification.

Regulatory Alignment

Compliant with GDPR, CCPA, GLBA, PCI DSS, SOX principles: auditability, data subject rights, and privacy by design.

Auditability and Governance

Logs all activities for lineage, traceability, and compliance audits (CloudTrail, CloudWatch).

Data Residency and Sovereignty

Configurable deployment within specific AWS regions to satisfy regional data regulations.

2. Product Capabilities
2.1 Core Functionality

Configured Tables reference owned datasets in S3/Glue with column-level whitelisting.

Analysis Rules define allowed queries (aggregation/list/custom) and enforce privacy thresholds.

Protected Queries (Analysis Jobs) execute pre-approved SQL templates or ad-hoc queries and produce controlled outputs.

Analysis Templates allow parameterized, repeatable analyses for business users while maintaining compliance.

2.2 Security Features

Privacy-Preserving Design
No raw data leaves the data owner‚Äôs account; only aggregated results are shared.

Cryptographic Protections
Optional hashed join keys and customer-managed KMS encryption for outputs.

Fine-Grained Access Control
Role-based IAM + Lake Formation permissions; ability to restrict result access per membership.

Comprehensive Logging and Monitoring
Full audit logs (create, update, execute) integrated with CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and Splunk for observability.

2.3 Scalability and Performance

Elastic Scaling
Serverless query execution auto-scales to handle large datasets and concurrent jobs.

Parallel Processing
Executes distributed queries with partition pruning and Parquet/columnar formats for efficiency.

Pay-Per-Query Model
Consumption-based pricing aligns cost with usage and supports budgeting across collaborations.

3. Technical Implementation Areas of Assessment
3.1 Data Ingestion and Preparation

üì• Ingestion Sources

S3 Buckets + Glue Data Catalog

Most common pattern; register Glue tables that reference S3 parquet/CSV datasets.

Redshift / Snowflake / External Data Lakes

Export and land into S3 before registering as configured tables.

Structured, Semi-structured Data

CSV, JSON, Parquet supported; schemas defined in Glue.

üìù Note: Data is not copied into Clean Rooms. It stays in the data owner‚Äôs account and is only queried via references.

üßÆ Data Preparation Steps

1. Data Selection & Pruning

Choose only the minimum required fields needed for the collaboration use case.

Exclude sensitive PII unless absolutely required (and if used, apply anonymization).

2. Join Key Generation & Hashing

If you need to join data across partners:

Generate deterministic hashed join keys (e.g., SHA-256 with a salt).

Store join keys in a new column (e.g. hashed_customer_id) and remove the original identifiers from the dataset.

Configure a Join Key Policy in the collaboration requiring hashed keys.

3. Schema Standardization

Ensure consistent formats for common fields across participants:

IDs: consistent length/format

Dates: ISO 8601

Numeric precision: standardized scale

Add these schemas to the Glue Data Catalog for discovery and versioning.

4. Sensitive Data Tagging & Governance

Use Lake Formation tags to mark sensitive columns and control access.

Only columns explicitly allowed will be queryable in Clean Rooms.

5. Quality & Cleansing

Deduplicate data using deterministic keys or ML-based entity resolution.

Validate for missing values, schema mismatches, and outlier patterns.

Apply address/phone/email normalization if needed for analytics joins.

6. Versioning & Change Control

Treat configured table schemas as immutable contracts.

Manage changes using Git-style version control for Glue table definitions.

Implement an approval workflow for any schema changes impacting collaborations.

Data Quality and Standardization
Deduplicate and normalize data (addresses, phones, IDs) upstream; tag sensitive fields for governance.

Metadata & Versioning
Catalog schemas in Glue with version control to support audits and change tracking.

3.2 Clean Room Configuration

Collaboration Setup
Create a collaboration, invite partner memberships, assign roles, define compute payer, enable query logging.

Configured Tables & Rules
Register tables from Glue or S3; attach Analysis Rules (aggregation, list, custom) to enforce privacy.

Output Controls
Apply Output Constraints (e.g., minimum row counts, DP noise, top-N suppression) to block risky results.

Join Key Policies
Require join keys to be hashed + salted with KMS to prevent ID exposure.

Template-Based Analysis
Define SQL templates with parameters to enforce consistent, controlled analysis patterns.

3.3 Integration with Capital One‚Äôs Data Ecosystem

IAM Integration
Reuse existing IAM roles and Lake Formation permissions to control access at table and column level.

Monitoring and Logging
Export Clean Rooms query logs and audit events to CloudWatch/Splunk for centralized monitoring.

Networking & Security
Keep data in-account using private endpoints and existing VPC architecture.

FinOps & Tagging
Tag resources by collaboration_id and membership_id to support cost allocation and usage tracking.

3.4 Security and Governance

Data Protection

AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, KMS CMKs for output encryption.

Optional cryptographic compute for encrypted-in-use processing.

Policy Management

Centralized definition and enforcement of collaboration policies (who can query what, where results go).

Audit & Compliance

Immutable logs and change history for SOX, GLBA, PCI DSS, and GDPR audits.

Incident Response

CloudWatch alerts + automated response runbooks for failed or suspicious queries.

3.5 Performance and Cost Optimization

Query Optimization

Partition pruning, columnar formats (Parquet), and materialized views reduce query runtime/cost.

Usage Analytics

Track costs and usage by collaboration, membership, and query job.

Budgeting Controls

Assign a compute payer membership; set usage limits and alerts.

Right-Sizing Strategy

Start with small pilot collaborations, benchmark performance, then scale gradually.

‚úÖ Summary:
This assessment confirms AWS Clean Rooms offers a secure, privacy-preserving, and cost-efficient platform for Capital One‚Äôs cross-partner analytics. It aligns with enterprise regulatory requirements, integrates with existing AWS and security infrastructure, and enables new business insights while safeguarding customer data.
